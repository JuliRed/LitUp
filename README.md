## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The most challenging part of the project was trying to implement functions in Javascript to add additional features I thought would be fun to have throughout the game. I did some reading on 2D games, saw some very interesting features on different projects but once I tried adding them to my project it all became a bit confusing. Honestly, I would've been able to make minor implementations had I had more time. Javascript is still very unfamiliar to me even though it seems having some underdstanding about C++ and Python is helpful. 
The challenges I encountered with HTML and CSS were related to the way the code is read differently by various browsers. It can be very challenging working on having a site look similar throughout several platforms. That was easily resolved once I read some documentation on what fonts and colors that would read across most browsers.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
The questions that came up as I was working through the project were mostly related to Javascript. Accessing HTML elements in a Javascript code left me with some unanswered questions as well as the ways a JavaScript code can be involved in an HTML file. I am very curious on how an API can be implemented in the code to make the game even more interactive as well as the use of libraries. 




4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Had I had more time, I would have liked to add additional features to the buttons: probably playing around with different sounds, adding images as the buttons get pressed on, and even being able to have them change shapes after a certain pattern is reached. I would have liked to add the secret random pattern style as well as change the speed of the game as the player guesses the pattern correctly. A fun idea would also be to have the page and buttons change colors as the game goes on making it more challenging as it progresses.
